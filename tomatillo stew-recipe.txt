Ingredients


Tomatillo Sauce

- 1 1/2 lbs 
tomatillos
- 1-2 
jalapeño 
chile peppers, or 2-3 serrano chili peppers (include the seeds if you 
want the heat, remove them if you don't want the heat), stems discarded, 
chopped
- 
1 clove garlic, chopped
- 
1 teaspoon salt
- 
2 Tbsp lime (or lemon) juice
- 
Pinch of sugar

Stew

- 
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, trimmed of excess 
fat, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 
Salt and pepper
- 
Olive oil
- 
2 yellow onions, chopped
- 
2 cloves garlic, minced
- 
1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 
1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 
1 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 
2 cups tomatillo sauce
- 
1 teaspoon dry oregano or 1 tablespoon fresh, chopped
- 
1/2 cup packed chopped cilantro (about one bunch, rinsed and chopped, 
stems and leaves)



Make the tomatillo sauce: 
Remove the papery husks from the tomatillos and rinse well. Cut the 
tomatillos in half and place them cut-side down on an aluminum foil-
lined roasting pan.

Broil for 5-7 minutes until blackened in spots. 
Let cool enough to handle.

Place the tomatillos, any juice they have 
released, chile peppers, garlic, salt, lime juice and sugar in a 
blender, and pulse until well blended. If you make ahead, refrigerate 
until needed.

Brown the chicken: 
Heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a large, thick-bottomed 
pot on medium high heat until almost smoking. Pat dry the cubed 
chicken parts with paper towels. Sprinkle salt and pepper over them.

 
Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, and adding more olive 
oil when necessary, brown the chicken pieces on two sides.

 When you 
place the pieces in the pan, make sure there is room between them 
(otherwise they will steam and not brown), and don't move them until 
they are browned on one side.

 Then use tongs or a metal spatula to 
turn them over and don't move them again until they are browned on 
the other side. Do not cook through, but only brown. 

Remove the 
chicken pieces from the pan and lower the heat to medium. There 
should be a nice layer of browned bits (fond) at the bottom of 
the pan. 



Cook the onions, add cumin and coriander, add garlic: 
Add the onions to the pan, and a tablespoon or two more olive 
oil if needed (likely). 

Add ground cumin and coriander. Cook a few 
minutes, stirring occasionally until onions are softened and the 
browned bits from the chicken have been picked up by the onions 
and are no longer sticking to the pan. 

Add the garlic and cook for 
30 seconds more, until fragrant.



Add the browned chicken, the tomatillo sauce, chicken stock, and 
oregano to the pan. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil and reduce 
to a simmer. 

Cook, partially covered, for 20 minutes until chicken 
is cooked through. Add the cilantro to the stew in the last minute 
or so of cooking.

Serve over white rice, accompanied with sour 
cream if needed to offset the heat from the chiles. The stew will 
thicken as it cools.
